# **Genomic Data Analysis for Differential Gene Expression**  

## Overview 
This project focuses on **genomic data analysis** to determine **differential gene expressions** and identify **upregulated and downregulated genes** associated with disease progression. By leveraging modern genomics technologies, this study evaluates gene expression patterns, providing insights into molecular mechanisms underlying disease conditions.  

Using **open-source tools like R and Bioconductor**, we analyze genetic data to explore gene regulation. This approach helps in understanding **mRNA and miRNA interactions**, where:  
- **Partial complementarity** between mRNA and miRNA inhibits translation.  
- **Complete complementarity** leads to transcript degradation.  

In diseases like cancer, **miRNA activity alterations** disrupt normal cell functions, contributing to **abnormal cell division, apoptosis, and angiogenesis**. This analysis allows researchers to track **tumor growth and gene regulation patterns**.  

## **Objectives**  
- Identify **gene expression patterns** involved in cell proliferation.  
- Determine **miRNAs regulating gene expression**.  
- Analyze genes responsible for **cancer development**.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Programming Language:** R  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**  
  - **Bioconductor** (genomic data processing)  
  - **limma** (differential gene expression analysis)  
  - **ggplot2** (data visualization)  
  - **edgeR** (RNA-seq analysis)  

## **Significance**  
This study enhances our understanding of **gene regulatory mechanisms** in cancer and other diseases, providing valuable insights into **potential therapeutic targets** for precision medicine.
